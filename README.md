sum
===

Sum of square of integers except negatives.

Description

    - We want to calculate a sum of squares of some integers, excepting negatives
    - The first line of the input will be an integer N (1 <= N <= 100)
    - Each of the following N test cases consist of one line containing an integer X (X <= 100), followed by X integers space-separated on the next line
    - For each test case, calculate the sum of squares of the integers excepting negatives, and print the calculated sum to the output. No blank line between test cases
    - (Take input from standard input, and output to standard output)
